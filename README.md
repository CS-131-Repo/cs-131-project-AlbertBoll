## Purpose of Repository

The Purpose of this Repository is to study a specific intrest related to this course, apply that priciple to solve a problem, then present. We can use this page to upload our work. In order to keep things organized I would suggest creating your own folder for a specific topic and working with others in that directory(folder) if you want to work on that topic. I invite anyone who has worked with github before to assist if you know best practices when it comes to colaboration.

1. Create a new branch for each new assignment. The name of the branch will be chosen by you but should be related to the assignment.
2. Complete all the requirements for each assignment.
3. Push all completed code to the branch.
4. Merge completed code back into the master branch.

If you need any help, contact me via email at zamoraae4572@student.laccd.edu, via Canvas or Discord (zruiz95)
